#Day48 of #100DaysChallenge 

Hey everyone!

Today marks day 48 of my 100 Days of Code challenge, and I'm feeling  tired.

I created a simple feedback interface. 

The image shows a feedback form with three emoji options: "Satisfied," "Neutral," and "Unsatisfied," along with a "Send" button. 

 Once feedback is submitted, it displays a "Thank you for your feedback!" message and shows the selected feedback.

That's it for today, folks I'm off to recharge! ðŸ’»ðŸ˜´
